# Weather Ready

Weather Ready is a forecase weather web application that provides users with weather data and clothing suggesstions based on their current or searched location.

## Why Did I Make This

I built this project to continue reinforcing my front-end skills, as well as practicing TypeScript and Redux. Although I probably didn't need to use Redux and RTK Query for this app, I decided I would do so anyways to solidify my studies.

I also thought the idea of clothing recommendations is neat and very useful. I find myself checking the weather and pondering what to wear before going out, or walking my dog Ada, so I decided this would be useful for me, and potentially for others.

## What Did I Learn

This project reinforced React, TypeScript and Redux skills, as well as unit testing with Jest.

Other skills I was able to improve on include: styling with Tailwind CSS, working with 3rd party APIs, RTK Query, use of a queue data structure, working with geolocation, and use of local storage.

## How To Use

Visit weatheready.com and all the use of your location. Weather data for your location will populate and the map radar will pan to your location.

You will see clothing recommendations based on the weather, and will have the option of answering a question about temperature preferences if you click the barometer icon next to the search bar.

The landing page is for current weather, and you can also view forecasted weather for the day, hourly and for the next 8 days. You can also view the a larger version of the radar map on the Radar page.

Clothing recommendations and accessories will be provided for every weather data set. Tooltips are provided when hovering, or on click for mobile users.
